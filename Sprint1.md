This is your first full development sprint. Your goal is to complete the tasks you have set out for this sprint. At the end of the sprint, tasks complete or otherwise, you will:

Submit answers to the retrospective questions
Update your backlogs
Set your tasks for the next sprint
The majority of your assessment grade will rest on your answers to the retrospective questions. There are no correct answers; we want to learn about your experience. 

The goal is to have you reflect on the sprint and learn from it. Your answers to the questions should demonstrate that you are working and reflecting on how you work so that you can improve. If we cannot understand what has happened or what you're doing, then it is difficult for us to assess your progress. To this end, we expect well-written answers with complete sentences and good grammar. Answers should be thorough, yet clear. Incomplete ideas and answers that lack explanation interferes with our understanding of your progress.
